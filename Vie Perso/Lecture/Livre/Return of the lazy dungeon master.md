## Review the characters 
- Write down the names, backgrounds and motivations of all the characters
- Review these character notes to prime your mind before the rest of the preparation
- Use this character review to help you tie the characters to the rest of your game

## Create a strong start
- What is happening? What event will frame the start of this section of adventure?
- What is the point? What seed or hook will lead the characters further into the adventure?
- Where's the action? Start as close as you can
- When in doubt start with combat

## Outline potential scenes
- Write down a short list of scenes that might occur in your game
- Remember that the goal of writing down scenes is primarily to help you feel prepared
- Scenes can occur in or out of sequence
- Write only as much as you need to remind yourself of what might happen
- Don't fall in love with your scenes. Be prepared to throw them away

## Define secrets and clues
- Write down ten secrets and clues that the characters might discover in the next game session
- Secrets and clues are the connective tissue of a campaign. After the start of the adventure, they are the second most important thing to prepare
- Each secret or clue reveals a piece of the story or the history of the world and its inhabitants
- Keep secrets and clues abstract from how they might be revealed. Improvise the discovery of secrets during the game
- Throw away secrets that aren't revealed during a session

## Develop fantastic locations
- Write down an evocative name for the location
- Write down three fantastic aspects of the location
- Plan on using 1 or 2 location per hour of play
- Make locations fantastic using age and size
- Tie some location to the background of the characters

## Outline important NPC
- NPC you prepare should primarily drive the game session and the adventure
- Keep your NPC outline brief: a name, a connection to the adventure and a character archetype from popular fiction
- Switch genders and avoid stereotypes
- Be ready to throw your NPCs away

## Choose relevant monsters
- Choose monsters that make sense for the story, situation and location
- Read monster books to prime your brain with new ideas and information for improvisation
- Keep a loose gauge of monster difficulty and character levels in mind
- Spend time building boss fights that account for character capabilities without negating those capabilities

## Select magic item rewards
